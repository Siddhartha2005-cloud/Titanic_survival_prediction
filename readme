# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project analyzes the famous **Titanic Dataset** to predict passenger survival using **Logistic Regression**.  
It demonstrates **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building**.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked for missing values.  
- Visualized survival rates by **sex, age, passenger class**.  
- Key insights:  
  - 👩 **Females** had a much higher survival rate than males.  
  - 👶 **Children** survived at higher rates than adults.  
  - 💼 **First-class passengers** had the highest survival rate, while third-class had the lowest.  

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing

- Dropped irrelevant columns (`PassengerId`, `Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`).  
- Encoded categorical variables:  
  - `Sex` → male = 1, female = 0.  
   - Scaled numerical features (`Age`) using **MinMaxScaler**.  
- Saved cleaned dataset as `impove_dataset.csv`.  

## 🤖 Model Building

- Used **Logistic Regression** as the ML model.  
- Split data into training & validation sets.  
- Evaluated performance using **accuracy score**.

## 📊 Model Evaluation

- Baseline accuracy achieved: **~77–80%**  

## 📌 Conclusion

This is **my first Machine Learning project**, where I worked on the Titanic dataset to:  
1. Clean and prepare raw data.  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract insights.  
3. Build and evaluate a Logistic Regression model.  

Key finding: **Survival strongly depended on gender, age, and passenger class.**
